<p align="center">
  ðŸ’» Mobile Software Engineer | React & React Native | iOS | SwiftUI
</p><br><br>

<p>I've been working in the field for more than 5 years and specialize in using modern technologies such as SwiftUI, ReactNative, ReactJS, NextJS, TypeScript and NodeJS to develop the best solutions. Working on various projects, I've gained solid experience in application management, queues and management in some government services.

Professionally, I have worked with agile methodologies, which have always been part of my professional culture. I have led and collaborated with cross-functional teams, ensuring scalability, performance and continuous improvement of resources for multiple high-impact applications.
I am a pragmatic innovator, constantly exploring new ways to implement creative solutions. My goal is to utilize the potential of technology to make a significant impact, improve processes and ultimately enrich end-user experiences.

I'm always seeking knowledge and improving my skills, and I'm always open to suggestions and ready for new challenges.</p>
